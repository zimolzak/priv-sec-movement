Privacy and Security 101
========

I've committed a PDF of version 0.1 of this handout, so people can get
a feel for the formatting.

See LaTeX file for the main and *updated* content! This Readme is
mainly for supplementary content for the presenters, not for the main
handout. The PDF won't *necessarily* be updated with each edit I make
to the LaTeX source, because I don't like doing that in Git
repositories.

why auto updates
--------

    \noindent Why auto updates? Example of the type of thing that gets fixed in
    updates (from the OpenSSL toolkit, January 2017): ``BN\_mod\_exp may
    produce incorrect results on x86\_64. There is a carry propagating bug
    in the x86\_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. No EC algorithms are
    affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a
    result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not
    believed likely\ldots{}.''

    I have no idea what Montgomery squaring is, although I sort of know
    what some of the other stuff is. I \emph{do} know that little things
    like this get fixed very often, and lots of little improvements add up
    to a big improvement.

* private mode avoids cookies and avoids storing history, but ISP can
  see what sites just fine. Tor stops that.

* ISP can see you're using Tor. VPN would be a next step on top of
  Tor.

* protonmail, mailvelope
* password manager
