Privacy and Security 101
========

This topic is a *process.* Nobody has to feel bad or get depressed
about not being "perfect." There is no finish line to cross. Feel good
that you moved yourself in the right direction *today*!

Who is the threat and why?
--------

* citizen vs. ads
* citizen w/ opinion vs. silencer, bully, doxing
* citizen vs. stalker
* citizen vs. identity theft
* citizen vs. malware, botnet managers

Menu of topics
--------

**Note to John:** This section needs the most review & will more or
less be my focus for the session.

You don't have to order one of everything on the menu! This is not a
checklist.

* don't let browser store password
* non gmail address
* non google web search
* non chrome browser
* don't repeat passwords
* phone lock instantly
* auto updates
* Tor browser
* Signal
* really random password
* disk encryption
* 2 factor auth
* click wisely (incl tracking links, not just phishing)
* think very hard before giving out any password
* beware public wifi
* don't auto-download email images
* don't give your email address to merchants etc who ask
* "checkout as guest" is at least one less account to worry about
* look which apps can track location in the background
* Consider not using "hey Siri," "OK Google," and related.
* Maybe not even Siri at all?

--------
* google alert on your name

* sign out of Facebook etc. when you're done (however, staying signed
  in may be better than giving browser your password).

* pay in cash
* check your facebook settings ("friends only")
* if not using Tor, clear out history & cookies every so often.

resources I've tried
--------
* https://haveibeenpwned.com/
* https://panopticlick.eff.org/

beyond 101, if you're interested
--------

* private mode avoids cookies, storing history, but ISP can what sites
  just fine. Tor stops that. vpn is next on top of that.

* GPG (email self defense)

* protonmail, mailvelope
