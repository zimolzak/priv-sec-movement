\maketitle

This topic is a \emph{process.} Nobody has to feel bad or get depressed
about not being ``perfect.'' There is no finish line to cross. Feel good
that you moved yourself in the right direction \emph{today!}

\section{Basic privacy/security tips}
You don't have to order one of everything on the menu! This is not a
checklist. The column ``Me'' is about whether I personally use this
tip all the time, some of the time, or currently not at all.

\noindent Why auto updates? Example of the type of thing that gets fixed in
updates (from the OpenSSL toolkit, January 2017): ``BN\_mod\_exp may
produce incorrect results on x86\_64. There is a carry propagating bug
in the x86\_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. No EC algorithms are
affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a
result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not
believed likely\ldots{}.''

I have no idea what Montgomery squaring is, although I sort of know
what some of the other stuff is. I \emph{do} know that little things
like this get fixed very often, and lots of little improvements add up
to a big improvement.
