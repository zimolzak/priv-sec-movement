This topic is a \emph{process.} Nobody has to feel bad or get depressed
about not being ``perfect.'' There is no finish line to cross. Feel good
that you moved yourself in the right direction \emph{today!}


\section{List of steps:}

You don't have to order one of everything on the menu! This is not a
checklist.

Why auto updates? Example of the type of thing that gets fixed in
updates (from the OpenSSL toolkit, January 2017): ``BN\_mod\_exp may
produce incorrect results on x86\_64. There is a carry propagating bug
in the x86\_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. No EC algorithms are
affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a
result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not
believed likely\ldots{}.''

I have no idea what Montgomery squaring is, although I sort of know
what some of the other stuff is. I \emph{do} know that little things
like this get fixed very often, and lots of little improvements add up
to a big improvement.
